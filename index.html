		<p id="about">The Powerpuff Girls tv show revolves around the adventures of Blossom, 
		Bubbles and Butttercup. The girls were created by Professor Utonium in 
		an attempt "to create the perfect little girls" using a mixture of 
		sugar, space and everything nice. However, he accidentally spilled a 
		mysterious substance called "chemical X" into the mixture giving all 
		three superpowers that they use to defend their ton from villains such 
		as giant monsters.</p>

	<h2>Blossom</h2>
		<p>is the self-proclaimed leader of the Powerpuff Girls. Her personality
		ingredient is "everything nice", her signature color is pink, and she has long
		red hair with a red bow. She was named for having spoken freely and honestly
		to the Professor shortly after her creation. Her unique power is freezing
		objects with her breath.</p>
	
		
	<h2>Bubbles</h2>
		<p>is the cute sensitive one. Her personality ingredient is sugar, her
		signature color is blue, and she has short blonde hair in two pigtails. 
		Bubbles is seen as kind and very sweet, but she is also capable of extreme
		rage and can fight monsters just as well as her sisters can. Her unique power
		is emitting supersonic waves with her voice.</p>
		
	
	<h2>Buttercup</h2>		
		<p>is the toughest of the three.  Her personality ingredient is spice, her 
		signature color is green, and she has short black hair in a flip.  She is a
		tomboy, who loves to get dirty, fights hard and plays rough.  Blossom is the
		only Powerpuff Girl without a unique super power.</p>
